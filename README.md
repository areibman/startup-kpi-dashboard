# Analytics

Since it will take way too long to set up something in Mixpanel or any of these other complex analytics dashboard, we're starting by posting all our analytics as Excel spreadsheets. This means we can use Pandas and Matplotlib to create all the dataviz we need. (Or, just native Excel).

## How to use
There are a set of template Excel spreadsheets in the `sample_sheets` directory. To input your own data, create a copy of each spreadsheet and put them in the root directory. Then, modify each row in Excel as needed.

To get the data visualizations, run `jupyter notebook` and execute each cell. Each data visualization should render according to your data in the spreadsheets.
